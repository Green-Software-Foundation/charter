# Joint Development Foundation Projects, LLC

##  Background

The Joint Development Foundation and its subsidiaries are dedicated to helping standards, specification, source code, and related projects start quickly and operate efficiently.  Joint Development Foundation Projects are ideal for long term standards, specification source code projects, data projects, or as a place to do incubation projects before taking those projects to larger organizations. 

By using established Joint Development Foundation legal agreements, groups can establish projects quickly and with minimal legal expense.  By operating under the Joint Development Foundation’s legal umbrella, Projects can enjoy the benefits of Joint Development Foundation’s existing legal agreements, choice of intellectual property policies, non-profit status, and corporate structure.  This enables Projects to more easily establish themselves, collect funds, issue press releases in the Project’s name, develop liaison relationships, and hold copyrights, all without negotiating custom agreements and new corporate organizations.

The Joint Development Foundation operates under a freemium-type model, where projects can be established and operated without paying anything.  Projects can provide their own infrastructure (websites, email reflectors, conference organization, etc.), or can work with Joint Development Foundation approved vendors to provide these types of services if they wish.

## Appendix A
**Traditional Mode Governance**

**1.	Working Group Chair.**  Each Working Group will designate a chair for that Working Group.  A Working Group may select a new chair upon Approval of the Working Group Participants.

**2.	Working Group Requirements.**  Each Working Group must be comprised of at least 2 Working Group Participants.  No Working Group Participant will be permitted to participate in a Working Group without first Joining the Working Group
  
**3.	Working Group Decision Making.**

3.1.	Consensus/Voting/Approval.  The Working Group will endeavor to make all decisions by consensus.  Where the Working Group cannot reach consensus with respect to a particular decision, the Working Group will make that decision by a Supermajority Vote of the Steering Members and General Members in this Working Group.
  	
3.2.	Appeals.  Working Group decisions may be appealed by issuing a written appeal to the Working Group Chair, and that appeal will be considered by the Working Group chair in good faith.  The Working Group Chair will respond in writing within a reasonable time.

3.3.	Notifications and Electronic Voting.  The Working Group Chair is responsible for issuing all notifications of meetings and votes of the Working Group subject to the following minimum criteria: (i) in-person meetings require at least 30 days prior written notice, (ii) teleconference meetings require at least 7 days prior written notice (this requirement only applies to the notification of the first meeting of automatically recurring teleconference meetings), (iii) electronic votes require no advance notice but must be made pursuant to a clear and unambiguous ballot with only “yes” and “no” options, and the voting must remain open for no less than 7 days.  These notification requirements with respect to the Project may be overridden upon unanimous consent of all Steering Members and General Members that have attended and participated in at least 50% of the last 4 meetings of the Project.

**4.	Deliverable Development Process.**

4.1.	Pre-Draft.  Any Working Group Participant or Contributor may submit a proposed initial draft document as a candidate Draft Deliverable of that Working Group.  The Working Group chair will designate each submission as a “Pre-Draft” document.

4.2.	Draft.  Each Pre-Draft document of a Working Group must first be Approved by the Working Group Participants of that Working Group to become a Draft Deliverable.  Once the Working Group approves a document as a Draft Deliverable, the Draft Deliverable becomes the basis for all going forward work on that deliverable.

4.3.	Working Group Approval.  Once a Working Group believes it has achieved the objectives for its deliverable as described in the Scope, it will progress its Draft Deliverable to “Working Group Approved” status. 

4.4.	Final Approval.  Upon a Draft Deliverable reaching Working Group Approved status, the Project Chair or his/her designee will present that Working Group Approved Draft Deliverable to all Steering Committee for Approval.  Upon Approval by the Steering Committee, that Draft Deliverable will be designated an “Approved Deliverable.”

4.5.	Publication and Submission.  Upon the designation of a Draft Deliverable as an Approved Deliverable, the Project Chair will publish the Approved Deliverable in a manner agreed upon by the Working Group Participants (i.e., Project Participant only location, publicly available location, Project maintained website, Project member website, etc.).  The publication of an Approved Deliverable in a publicly accessible manner must include the terms under which the Approved Deliverable and/or source code is being made available under, as set forth in the applicable Working Group Charter.

4.6.	Submissions to Standards Bodies.  No Draft Deliverable or Approved Deliverable may be submitted to another organization without Approval by the Steering Committee.  Upon Approval by the Steering Committee, the Project Chair will coordinate the submission of the applicable Draft Deliverable or Approved Deliverable to another standards development organization with Joint Development Foundation Projects, LLC.  Working Group Participants that developed that Draft Deliverable or Approved Deliverable agree to grant the copyright rights necessary to make those submissions.

**5.	Definitions.**  Definitions are set forth below.  Terms not defined in the Working Group Charter will have the definitions set forth in the Project Charter.

## Sponsorship Agreement
Directed Fund Agreement between the Project Participants and the Linux Foundation

Funding for this Project is facilitated via a Linux Foundation Directed Fund, which is managed by Linux Foundation on behalf of the Project and subject to the direction of the Project’s Steering Committee.  To facilitate this arrangement, each Steering Member and General Member sponsoring the Project (each a “Fund Participant”) enters into this Directed Fund Participation Agreement directly with the Linux Foundation under the following terms: 

1.	Membership.  The sponsoring member (“Fund Participant”) acknowledges that its financial support of the Project is as a member of the Linux Foundation. Linux Foundation membership is a prerequisite for participation in this Project Sponsorship Agreement.

2.	Sponsorship Terms.  The Fund Participant agrees to pay an annual sponsorship amount (“Participation Fee”) to the Linux Foundation Directed Fund per the chosen Sponsorship Level. The Participation Fee is due within 30 days of the execution date of this agreement, and within 30 days of each anniversary of that date under the then current sponsorship amount.

3.	Termination.  This agreement will automatically terminate upon termination of your membership status in the Project.  In addition, Linux Foundation may terminate this Agreement upon notice to you in the event that (a) the Project discontinues operations or otherwise ceases to function, (b) you are in material breach of any of the charters or policies of the Project or policies of the Linux Foundation (copies of which are maintained on the Linux Foundation web site), (c) the Steering Committee of the Project requests that we terminate this agreement, (d) you cease to be a member of the Project, or (e) applicable law or regulation would prohibit our ability to continue to receive the Participation Fee. No refunds will be given on payments made under this agreement for any reason.  

The Linux Foundation will apply the Participation Fee as directed by the Steering Committee of the Project as consistent with the tax-exempt status and mission of The Linux Foundation and the Project. Linux Foundation will have custody of and final authority over the usage of the Participation Fee.  A general and administrative fee (“G&A Fee”) will be applied by the Linux Foundation to funds raised to cover finance, accounting, and operational support for the Project, and paid to Linux Foundation from all such Project Participation Fees and other gross receipts received with respect to the Project. The annual G&A Fee will be 9% of the all gross receipts received to support the Project (whether through the collection of Project Participation Fees, event revenues or otherwise) with respect to the first $1,000,000 of annual gross receipts and 6% of annual gross receipts above $1,000,000.
